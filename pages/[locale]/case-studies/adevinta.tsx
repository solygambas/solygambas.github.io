        As a creative technologist, technical architect, and lead developer, I
        was the first developer to join the design team of 25 at leboncoin
        marketplace. My role involved auditing and enhancing the design system,
        collaborating closely with a dedicated designer.
      </p>

      <p className={kanitLight.className}>
        After a year of refining our processes, we seized the opportunity to
        expand our design system across Europe in collaboration with other
        Adevinta marketplacesâ€”Kleinanzeigen in Germany, Milanuncios in Spain,
        Subito in Italy, and Marktplaats/2dehands in Benelux. Together with
        colleagues from Spain and Germany, we formed a specialized team of 20
        members focused solely on the design system for web, native iOS, and
        native Android platforms.
      </p>

      <p className={kanitLight.className}>
        Our efforts were part of a broader initiative to consolidate our
        expertise and facilitate seamless brand transitions. To achieve this, I
        developed a Figma solution and implemented a pipeline to automate the
        delivery of icons and color tokens directly from Figma to developers.
      </p>

      <p className={kanitLight.className}>
        Starting with just a designer and a small team, we made remarkable
        progress in two years, impacting our entire group. Collaborating in an
        international setting was both rewarding and challenging. I particularly
        enjoyed empowering designers and developers to leverage our components
        for faster interface development.
