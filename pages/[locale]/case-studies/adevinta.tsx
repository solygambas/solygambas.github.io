    "As a creative technologist, technical architect, and lead developer, I was the first developer to join the design team of 25 at leboncoin marketplace. My role involved auditing and enhancing the design system, collaborating closely with a dedicated designer.",
    "After a year of refining our processes, we seized the opportunity to expand our design system across Europe in collaboration with other Adevinta marketplacesâ€”Kleinanzeigen in Germany, Milanuncios in Spain, Subito in Italy, and Marktplaats/2dehands in Benelux. Together with colleagues from Spain and Germany, we formed a specialized team of 20 members focused solely on the design system for web, native iOS, and native Android platforms.",
    "Our efforts were part of a broader initiative to consolidate our expertise and facilitate seamless brand transitions. To achieve this, I developed a Figma solution and implemented a pipeline to automate the delivery of icons and color tokens directly from Figma to developers.",
    "Starting with just a designer and a small team, we made remarkable progress in two years, impacting our entire group. Collaborating in an international setting was both rewarding and challenging. I particularly enjoyed empowering designers and developers to leverage our components for faster interface development.",
